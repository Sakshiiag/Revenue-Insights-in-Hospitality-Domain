# Revenue-Insights-in-Hospitality-Domain

* A company noticed a loss in their market share and revenue over a few months. To understand the cause of their loss, they needed a way to analyze this. So I created a dashboard in Power BI using three months of data.
  
* With the created dashboard, Revenue team of the company were able to gain insights about their revenue trend. This could help in regaining their revenue and market share by 20% in the next month.

* Skills Used: Power BI, Excel.
